**PyCon 2010 Reflections**

 * Mike and Chris were impressed by the community and the group focus
 * `Ruby sucks <http://vimeo.com/9471538>`_. Mike said it. Bring it, kids.
 * `Titus <http://ivory.idyll.org/about.html>`_ likes `Distribute
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_ and `Pip
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_. Who knows why?
 * What can we learn from `PyCon <http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/>`_ for
   regional conferences like `PyOhio <http://www.pyohio.org/>`_?
 * Dave’s done a lot of thinking about testing
 * He finds that nothing lets him test the way he wants.
 * He uses `nose <http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/>`_, `mock
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock>`_, and `dingus
   <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dingus/0.1>`_
 * `Mote <http://bitbucket.org/garybernhardt/mote/>`_ might be good for BDD, but Dave finds it lacking.
 * Dave hates documentation. Tests **could** be like documentation, and would be more accurate over time.
 * Mote parses the output more like a narrative, almost like a spec, instead of …..F….
 * We work with a large system, and rest assured, code is not documentation. Tests could be.
 * Oh..we ramble about this for a while. PyCon? What’s PyCon?  Oh…right…the Testing BOF.
 * There was a Testing Goat. `Terry Peppers
   <http://www.swordstyle.com/blog2/?p=1822>`_ is somehow responsible for it.
   Mike Pirnat needed one. `Gary Bernhardt <http://blog.extracheese.org/>`_ was
   the goat. We want pictures. ‘Nuff said?
 * `Look into Mike’s .vimrc <https://github.com/mcrute/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/vimrc>`_. Behold the wonder.
 * Right. PyCon. Remember Pycon?  `David Beazley’s talk on the GIL <http://www.dabeaz.com/python/GIL.pdf>`_ was dead sexy.
 * The `Brandon Rhodes’ <http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/>`_ discussion of the Dictionary Object. Awesome.
 * Chris thought Titus’s talk on Continuous Integration frameworks was great.
 * Oh look. Back to testing. We like talking about testing. Look for a show or two on testing. Wait! Don’t leave!
 * Chris was impressed with the diversity of the community and how friendly people were.
 * And about the vendors. What did we think about the vendors? We like Swag. And sometimes we buy books. And hats.
 * “I use vim, so I don’t really need an IDE.” Flame. Discuss.
 * We generally have a good opinion of companies using open source and who participate in the community.
 * We enjoyed hacking together, especially on Mike’s `snakeplan <http://bitbucket.org/mcrute/snakeplan/>`_.
 * We need `DCVS achievements <http://benjamin-meyer.blogspot.com/2010/03/git-achievements.html>`_. Like games. But better.
 * `Catherine Devlin’s <http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/>`_ `cmd2 <http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/python-cmd2>`_ was sweet.
 * `You might be eaten by a grue. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_%28monster%29>`_
 * `Python is used by the military to create simulations.
   <http://www.thebitsource.com/tech-conferences/pycon-2010-python-modeling-battelfield-military-defense/>`_
   Thanks, Eric Silverman!
 * Atlanta, however, was…meh. We’d prefer Cleveland. We’re not biased. Nope. And it’s not Detroit, right?
