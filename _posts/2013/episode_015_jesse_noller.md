<div class="excerpt" markdown="1">
By popular demand, From Python Import Podcast returns from the dead with a
brand-new, supersized episode of epicness featuring an in-depth conversation
with [Jesee Noller][jesse], PSF board member, core developer, chair of [PyCon
2012][pycon2012] and [2013][pycon2013], and all-around [hoopy frood][hoopy].
Over the course of nearly two hours, we get an inside look at the [Python
Software Foundation][psf], being a core developer, bringing a [code of
conduct][coc] to the Python community, community outreach and diversity, the
joys and anguish of running a major conference, how to get involved in Python
or PyCon, the work he's doing with [Rackspace][rackspace] to inspire developers
to build cool things, some Python trivia, and various strategies for discovering
and curating collections of animated GIFs.

We'd not only like to thank Jesse for his time and candor, but we'd also like
to thank each and every one of you for listening, for subscribing, for tweeting,
for saying hello at conferences, for encouraging us to create new episodes
again.  Every little bit, every interaction--no matter how trivial it might
seem--matters. You made this episode happen, and hopefully many more to come.
Thank you.
