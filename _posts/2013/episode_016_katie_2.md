<div class="excerpt" markdown="1">
In this episode, we're pleased to catch up with the one, the only, the
*real* [Katie Cunningham][katie] to catch up on some great stuff that she's
been up to.  We chat about the [Young Coders tutorial][young-coders-pycon2013]
(which you can totally [contribute to][young-coders-github] or [help
scale][katie-pycon]), [her Python article][hoc-article] for [Hour of Code][hoc],
[being good to students who run Windows][os-divide], her brand-new book
_[Teach Yourself Python in 24 Hours][python-book]_, and the Python 2–Python 3
divide.  We also check in on the state of accessibility (which we last talked
about [way back in episode 10][ep10]) and discover that [there's a book for
that][a11y-book] too.

All this plus cookies, news, the return of Python trivia, and lots of things to
link to!
