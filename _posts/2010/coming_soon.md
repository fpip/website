Pardon our dust, beer cans, and old fast food bags. We’re in the process of
setting up the site for the new podcast. We recorded the first episode two days
ago, and thus far, we’re not thoroughly displeased with it.

Major renovations are coming this weekend, but the podcast looks as if it will
debut on 4/1/2010 as planned.

No, it’s not a joke. Stop asking.
