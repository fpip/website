title: Shiny New Website
---
One of the reasons that we've sucked about recording new content since
[PyCon](http://us.pycon.org) is that [Mike](http://mike.pirnat.com) has been
diligently tinkering away on a brand new design for the website.
We're pleased to announce that the new site is now live, just in time for
[PyOhio](http://pyohio.org) lightning talks!

The new site features:

 * Spiffy HTML 5 audio tags for in-browser listening
 * Responsive design that looks great on your phone, tablet, or desktop
 * Finally incorporates album art design into the site
 * Contact form
 * Social network sharing buttons to help promote your favorite episodes

We'll probably still be messing with a few things and will add some features
that we didn't have time to get to in our mad dash to get live, so stay tuned.

If you had subscribed in iTunes, please check to make sure that's still going
on and resubscribe if need be; apparently we had a damaged feed a month or two
ago and fell out of the iTunes listings.  (Yes, we know, this totally sucks and
we're idiots. No one feels worse about it than we do.)

On the plus side, now we can actually focus on maybe making a few new episodes.
Madness!
