<div class="excerpt" markdown="1">
At long last, we finally get down to some Real Talk about Python 3.  In
this episode, [Mike][mpirnat] and [Dave][dnoyes] are joined by guests [Nick
Coghlan][nick] and [Alex Gaynor][alex]; our discussion gets into the history of
Python 3's development, why it's compelling, whether it's a failure, and more.
We also chat for a bit about Alex's new [Cryptography][crypto] library and the
downfall of "abstinence-only" crypto education.

All this plus some news and the return of the return of Python trivia!  Read on
for some additional thoughts as well as a plethora of links for this episode.

First of all, we'd like to apologize for the delay.  We had almost managed to
settle into an every-other-month cadence when we were stricken with scheduling
conflicts and the unexpected death of our editing platform. (And oh, how the
sadhorns did play!)  Work and pre-PyCon complications followed.

While we were sorting out all of the above, Python 3.4 was released, and it's
really exciting because it has [seriously cool things][whatsnew] that we somehow
failed to discuss at all during our recording session a couple weeks prior
(though we may have mentioned some highlights [last time][ep16]).

Behold, a parade of links, for your clicking enjoyment!
