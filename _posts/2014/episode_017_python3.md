<div class="excerpt" markdown="1">
At long last, we finally get down to some Real Talk about Python 3.  In
this episode, [Mike][mpirnat] and [Dave][dnoyes] are joined by guests [Nick
Coghlan][nick] and [Alex Gaynor][alex]; our discussion gets into the history of
Python 3's development, why it's compelling, whether it's a failure, and more.
We also chat for a bit about Alex's new [Cryptography][crypto] library and the
downfall of "abstinence-only" crypto education.

All this plus some news and the return of the return of Python trivia!  Read on
for some additional thoughts as well as a plethora of links for this episode.

First of all, we'd like to apologize for the delay.  We had almost managed to
settle into an every-other-month cadence when we were stricken with scheduling
conflicts and the unexpected death of our editing platform. (And oh, how the
sadhorns did play!)  Work and pre-PyCon complications followed.

Secondly, a heads up--though we're trying to improve the audio quality (Dave
has a microphone now!), Google Hangout seems to have betrayed us, introducing
mystery pops and clicks that have thus far resisted our attempts to scrub them
out in post.  For some reason they seem to only affect one segment of the
recording, so please bear with it for a couple minutes--the main interview
portion of the episode is click-free.  We're very sorry, and all we can do
about it at this point is to promise that we'll keep working on it.

While we were fighting through  all of the above, Python 3.4 was released, and
it's really exciting because it has [seriously cool things][whatsnew] that we
somehow failed to discuss at all during our recording session a couple weeks
prior (though we may have mentioned some highlights [last time][ep16]).

Behold, a parade of links, for your clicking enjoyment!
