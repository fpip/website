What can we say about Katie? We met her at PyCon 2012 and, frankly, we were
starstruck. She's a woman of many talents...

* `She codes! <http://therealkatie.net/projects/>`_
* `She does things to the Internet! <http://therealkatie.net/about/>`_
* `She blogs! <http://therealkatie.net/blog/>`_
* `She talks sometimes! <http://therealkatie.net/talks/>`_
* `She likes to hear from people! <http://therealkatie.net/contact/>`_

Most importantly, she's a pythonista and she agreed to talk with us. This is
that talk. Enjoy!
