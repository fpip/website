<div class="excerpt" markdown="1">
In the latest exciting episode of From Python Import Podcast, we had the
pleasure of sitting down with
[James Tauber][jt] ([Pinax][pinax], [Eldarion][eldarion]),
[Kenneth Reitz][kr] ([Requests][requests], [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python][pg], [Tablib][tablib]),
and [Chad Whitacre][cw] ([Gittip][gittip], [Aspen][aspen])
for an end-of-conference chat at [PyOhio][pyohio] 2012.

We could try to summarize the conversation here, but it frankly wouldn't
do it justice.  This is a great conversation between some bright guys, and
it was a ton of fun to bring them all together. The links above will get
you started, but you are best served to listen and simply enjoy.

 * [Habitualist][hab]
