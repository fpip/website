title: Episode 012 - Jonathan LaCour
---
In this episode, we interview
[Jonathan LaCour](https://en.twitter.com/#!/cleverdevil),
VP of Software Development at [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/),
about the cool things they're up to with Python and--*dramatic chord*--The Cloud.

This is the last of our interviews from PyCon, so I guess that means we have to
get off our butts and make some more episodes happen.  Don't panic--we don't
plan to disappear for a year again (though that wasn't really our plan to begin
with).  In fact, with any luck, we should be recording at least one episode in
the next few days to help get us back on track.

**The audio for this episode is taking a quick vacation and will be back soon.**
